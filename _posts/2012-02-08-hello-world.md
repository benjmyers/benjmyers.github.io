title: Hello, world!

Welcome to [Hyde](http://andhyde.com), the perfect companion to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the popular static site generator. Hyde is an elegant, open source, mobile first theme for Jekyll. It includes lightweight styles and placeholder content to get you up and running with a simple blog in no time.

Hyde is also rather forward-thinking in that—in addition to Chrome, Safari, and Firefox—it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

Thanks!
