I created this website using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> for a few reasons. One, I felt like learning something new. Two, Jekyll is light weight which was all I needed for a simple portfolio site. Third, my portfolio items (or "posts", since Jekyll is pitched for blogs) are written mostly in markdown which greatly simplifies the process of adding new items and means less handcoding of HTML.

For styling, I started with <a href="http://andhyde.com" target="_blank">Hyde</a>, an open source theme with mobile support. A huge thank you goes to Hyde's creator. I made my own customizations on top of Hyde's base CSS.
