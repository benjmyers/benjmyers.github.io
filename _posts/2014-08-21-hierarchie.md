Hierarchie is a structured display of topics from discussion surrounding the MH-370 airliner disappearance. Run on a corpus of Tweets, Reddit comments, and Daily Beast articles, Hierarchical LDA was used to create a structure of topic models. The Hierarchie application allows the user to explore this structure. 

I worked on Hierarchie at my current employer, Decisive Analytics, and they were kind enough to allow us to open source our research in a paper and the application on GitHub. 

The application and research was presented at the <a href="http://acl2014.org/" target="_blank">Association of Computational Linguists Conference</a> in Baltimore, MD, last June.
