My Electronics II Midterm Project was "create a game", and after a few hours this is what resulted. All code and wiring was done by yours truly.

From my in-class write up:
> Ballduino Breaker is a classic brick breaker game adapted for the Arduino microcontroller. Utilizing a graphic LCD and a simple potentiometer to control paddle motion, the user is able to successfully bounce a ball about the screen and break bricks until all bricks are destroyed (the user wins) or the ball falls off the screen (the user loses).
An ATmega 328P microcontroller and a KS0108 Graphic LCD were used.The Atmega 328P is directly connected to the Graphic LCD, which has a 128 by 64 pixel screen. The program utilizes the KS0108 Graphics LCD Library (GLCD), available from the Arduino Playground (playground.arduino.cc), for easily interfacing with the LCD. GLCD provides a series of method calls that handle the initialization and clearing of the LCD, drawing of various shapes, and rendering of text.
