For my Electronics II final project, a friend and I took on the task of building and programming a Quadcopter. With only three weeks of time, we realized programming the flight control ourselves was pretty much impossible, although I was able to write some code to have two motors "balance" themselves on either end of a seesaw type contraption. 

We utilized an Arduino Uno paired with Xbee radio to control flight wirelessly using a Wii Nunchuck that sent signals through another Xbee. The Arduino on board the copter was then connected to a MultiWii 328P Flight Controller. The flight controller had an on board gyro, accelerometer, and magnetometer. 

On demo day, our limited time showed that more time would've been needed to properly calibrate the flight controller and balance the motors. Still, the quadcopter managed to "jump" into the air and traveled a few feet a few inches above the ground on one of its more successful flights. The heat generated by the large on board batteries generated a lot of heat and popped some solder joints, so after a quick repair in the lab it was back in flight. While it wasn't as successful as we would've liked (not quite ready for Amazon Air), it was impressively strong and turned almost the entire Physics/Comp Sci department out for the demo.
