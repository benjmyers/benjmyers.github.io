Model Company is my current project in progress. When finished, it will allow visualization and comparison of personal traits and statistics - like height, age, occupation, and method of discharge - of a Civil War company of 100 men. It will also offer comparison of traits at the "mess" level - groupings of about 20 soldiers that were chosen by the men and often consisted of family, close friends and neighbors. This research, collected from private and unpublished 150 year old documents, is extraordinarily rare and will offer an unprecedented look into the physical and social traits of a "common" and hard fought Civil War regiment.

One of my main interests is combining technology and history to make it more relevant and accessible to both children and adults. After releasing a 'version one' of the application, I was incredibly pleased to learn that a professor at Carelton University used Model Company in one of his classes.

In addition to allowing me to display some cool history, Model Company is also my first full fleged Angular application and served as a great learning experience.
