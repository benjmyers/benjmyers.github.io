This is a version of Tetris, written in x86 without interrupts. Why would one not take advantage of such an inherent part of assembly languages? Because the professor said so, I really don't know why. It’s somewhat functional… the pieces move down and stack up, but full lines do not clear off the screen nor can the pieces rotate. The code is also somewhat messy. I’m comfortable with this fact because the game was written after having one prior x86 assignment, and the whole thing was completed in a few days.
