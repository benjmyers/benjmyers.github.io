                <p>I designed and helped implement this website that tracks the Department of Education's investigations into colleges' handling of sexual assault. Users can search, filter, and group investigations by attributes like state and type of complaint. Investigation specifics like documents, details, and links are also available.</p>

                <p>There are a lot of rats in New York City, and a lot of people complaining about them. This map shows the most recent 311 'Rodent' complaints, updated daily.</p>
                <p class="tools">The web application is Angular and uses Leaflet with various plugins for the rat data.</p>

For the version 2 redesign which was launched April 7th, 2016, I did a full overhaul of the website architecture, design, and visualizations. We also added functionality allowing submission of salaries.</p>

                <p>Who was the common Civil War soldier?

                <p>Recent protests at universities nation-wide have raised an important question: just how diverse are colleges? Using data from the Department of Eduction, I analyzed the diversity of faculty and students at flagship universities in all fifty states. Comparisons of student and faculty diversity with that of the region and nation as a whole show the stunning lack of diversity currently found on flagship campuses nationwide.</p>
                <p class="tools">MySQL was used for data analysis, and visualizations are D3 and D4. I also created the static graphics.</p>
