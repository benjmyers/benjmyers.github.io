                <p>Faculty, staff, and adjunct data for over 4,700 colleges and universities. For the version 2 redesign which was launched April 7th, 2016, I did a full overhaul of the website architecture, design, and visualizations. We also added functionality allowing submission of salaries.</p>
                <p class="tools">Angular application, Django API, D3 visualizations.</p>

                <p>Who was the common Civil War soldier? I researched, designed, implemented, and wrote the accompanying article for this project that explores the personal attributes, occupations, and fates of 92 soldiers. This piece will be published in an upcoming edition of the Civil War Times.</p>
                <p class="tools">For this project, I used Angular for the web application and D3 and Leaflet for data visualizations.</p>

                <a href="http://chronicle.com/interactives/flagship-diversity"><h1>The Flagship Diversity Divide</h1></a>
                <p>Recent protests at universities nation-wide have raised an important question: just how diverse are colleges? Using data from the Department of Eduction, I analyzed the diversity of faculty and students at flagship universities in all fifty states. Comparisons of student and faculty diversity with that of the region and nation as a whole show the stunning lack of diversity currently found on flagship campuses nationwide.</p>
                <p class="tools">MySQL was used for data analysis, and visualizations are D3 and D4. I also created the static graphics.</p>

                <p>How do donors give throughout the year? This project gives readers a unique look at when donors give and the causes they support. Using Python to run a weekly analysis on online giving data, the text for this article is programmatically generated. </p>
                <p class="tools">Python and MySQL were used to automate weekly data analysis, along with QGIS and TileMill for rendering map tiles. Driveshaft populates the interactives (D3 and Leaflet) with data.</p>

                <p>How many years would you have to work at minimum wage to afford sticker price tuition at a flagship? This interactive allows users to get an idea of the enormous cost of higher education, and how it has increased over time.</p>
                <p class="tools">Data analysis in MySQL, D3 for visualization.</p>

                <p>In this analysis, we found that geographic areas with high standards of living often have low rates of charitable giving. I partnered with a reporter to investigate the underlying reasons for this trend.</p>
                <p class="tools">D3 was used for the choropleth map.</p>

                <p>There are a lot of rats in New York City, and a lot of people complaining about them. This map shows the most recent 311 'Rodent' complaints, updated daily.</p>
                <p class="tools">The web application is Angular and uses Leaflet with various plugins for the rat data.</p>
