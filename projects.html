                <p>Climate change and rising seas pose an unprecedented threat to coastal colleges. I pitched, reported, designed,
                    and developed this in depth look at how four universities around the country are planning for the years
                    ahead. I'm really proud of this presentation because it was unlike anything
                    <em>The Chronicle</em> had before published.</p>

                <p>I reported, designed, and implemented this project which takes a look at cost of living estimates generated
                    by colleges. Across the nation, students are often given an innacurate estimate that can have a big impact
                    on their finances and educational outcomes.</p>

                    I created a series of maps showing the route Captain Brooks's regiment, the 46th Pennsylvania Infantry,
                    marched during the Civil War. For these, I did everything from generating a basemap using Digital Elevation
                    Models to creating a Civil War era roads shapefile and geocoding locations relevant to the regiment.</p>
