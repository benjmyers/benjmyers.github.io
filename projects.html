                <p>Who was the common Civil War soldier? I researched, designed, implemented, and wrote the accompanying article for this project that explores the personal attributes, occupations, and fates of 92 soldiers. An abridged version of this piece was feature in the August 2016 issue of <i>Civil War Times</i> magazine.</p>

                <p>I designed and helped implement this website that tracks the Department of Education's investigations into colleges' handling of sexual assault. Users can search, filter, and group investigations by attributes like state and type of complaint. Investigation specifics like documents, details, and links are also available.</p>

                <p>Protests at universities nation-wide during 2015 raised an important question: just how diverse are colleges? Using data from the Department of Eduction, I analyzed the diversity of faculty and students at flagship universities in all fifty states. Comparisons of student and faculty diversity with that of the region and nation as a whole show the stunning lack of diversity currently found on flagship campuses nationwide.</p>
                <p class="tools">MySQL was used for data analysis, and visualizations are D3 and D4. Illustrator for static graphics.</p>

                <p>How do donors give throughout the year? This project gives readers a unique look at when donors give and the causes they support. Using Python to run a weekly analysis on online giving data, the text for this article is programmatically generated.</p>
                <p class="tools">Python and MySQL automate weekly data analysis, along with GDAL and TileMill for rendering map tiles. Driveshaft populates the interactives (D3 and Leaflet) with data.</p>

                <p>Faculty, staff, and adjunct data for over 4,700 colleges and universities. For the version 2 redesign which was launched in the spring of 2016, I did a full overhaul of the website architecture, design, and visualizations. We also added functionality allowing submission of salaries.</p>

                <p class="tools">The web application is Angular and uses Leaflet with various plugins for the rat data.</p>

                <p>How many years would you have to work at minimum wage to afford sticker price tuition at a flagship? This interactive allows users to get an idea of the enormous cost of higher education, and how it has increased over time.</p>
