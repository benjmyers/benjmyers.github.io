<h2>About Me</h2>

<h3>Work</h3>
<p>
I’m currently employed at Mission Focus in Alexandria, VA. My work there ranges from front end web development (Javascript, D3, Ember.js), to REST API work (Clojure, Compojure), to Java, Hadoop, Accumulo, and hardware setup and maintenance. Typically I’m interacting with many of these things in one day.</p>

<p>In the past (June 2011 to April 2013) I worked  as an intern on the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA)’s Transformative Apps Program, aimed at providing combat military personnel with tactical Android smartphones. I had some great experiences at there, ranging from provisioning phones, training military personnel, and mentoring junior interns. Most notably, I solely developed an Android application used in Afghanistan to make the process of tactical evidence collection easier.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>In May of 2013, I graduated Summa Cum Laude from American University in Washington, DC with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Audio Technology. In addition to my studies, I was a member of AU’s ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) and UPE (Upsilon Pi Epsilon International Honor Society for the Computing and Information Disciplines) chapters. In 2012 I was awarded UPE’s “Special Recognition” Scholarship, one of seventeen awarded nationally. I also spent time helping my fellow students with school work, projects, and test prep.</p>

<h3>Hobbies & Other Interests</h3>

<p>In my spare time I enjoy travel, hiking, reading, and historical research. I'm looking to publish my first book within the next year.</p>
