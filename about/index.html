        CAREER
    </div>
    <p>I'm currently employed by Decisive Analytics Corporation in Arlington, VA. At DAC, I primarily create Angular.js web applications for data visualization. Our visualizations, usually leveraging D3.js, focus on the fields of Computational Linguistics and Machine Learning. I also participate in research, typically utilizing Java, and the authoring of academic papers. The first paper to which I contributed was published and presented at the Association of Computational Linguistics Conference in June of 2014. You can find more information about the paper <a href="http://mlvl.github.io/Hierarchie/#/about">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Part of our data visualization mission at Decisive Analytics is to contribute to the open source community. To promote that cause, we've created the <a href="https://mlvl.github.io">Machine Learning Visualization Lab</a> as an outlet for our research and open source contributions. While the Machine Learning Visualization Lab is still in its infancy, we're working to build it into a well known source of cutting edge data visualization.</p>

    <p>Before Decisive Analytics, I worked at a small contractor called Mission Focus in Alexandria, VA. My work there ranged from front end web development (Javascript, D3, Ember.js), to REST API work (Clojure, Compojure), to Java, Hadoop, Accumulo, and hardware setup and maintenance.</p>

    <p>Prior to my web career, I worked as an intern on the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA)’s Transformative Apps Program, aimed at providing combat military personnel with tactical Android smartphones. I had some great experiences there, ranging from provisioning phones, training military personnel, and mentoring junior interns. Most notably, I solely developed an Android application used in Afghanistan to make the process of tactical evidence collection easier.</p>

        EDUCATION
    </div>
    <p>In May of 2013, I graduated Summa Cum Laude from American University in Washington, DC with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Audio Technology. In addition to my studies, I was a member of AU’s ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) and UPE (Upsilon Pi Epsilon International Honor Society for the Computing and Information Disciplines) chapters. In 2012 I was awarded UPE’s “Special Recognition” Scholarship, one of seventeen awarded nationally. I also spent time helping my fellow students with school work, projects, and test prep.</p>

        EVERYTHING ELSE
    </div>
    <p>I have too many interests! Travel, reading, historical research, and spending time with family fill my evenings and weekends. I consider finance and antiquing hobbies, and I'm not ashamed to admit it! I'm currently working toward publishing my first book, which tells the story of American Civil War Captain George A. Brooks, who was killed in the Battle of Antietam while commanding my great, great, great grandfather's company.</p>
