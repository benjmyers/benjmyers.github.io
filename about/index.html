        Work
    </div>
    <p>I'm currently employed by Decisive Analytics Corporation in Arlington, VA. My daily tasks range from Angular application development, data visualization with D3, server-side setup with JAX-RS, and from time to time some Java. I get to work with and try out a lot of different technologies, techniques, and designs every day!</p>

    <p>Before my current job, I worked at a small contractor in Alexandria, VA. My work there ranged from front end web development (Javascript, D3, Ember.js), to REST API work (Clojure, Compojure), to Java, Hadoop, Accumulo, and hardware setup and maintenance.</p>

    <p>Prior to my web career, I worked as an intern on the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA)’s Transformative Apps Program, aimed at providing combat military personnel with tactical Android smartphones. I had some great experiences there, ranging from provisioning phones, training military personnel, and mentoring junior interns. Most notably, I solely developed an Android application used in Afghanistan to make the process of tactical evidence collection easier.</p>

        Education
    </div>
    <p>In May of 2013, I graduated Summa Cum Laude from American University in Washington, DC with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Audio Technology. In addition to my studies, I was a member of AU’s ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) and UPE (Upsilon Pi Epsilon International Honor Society for the Computing and Information Disciplines) chapters. In 2012 I was awarded UPE’s “Special Recognition” Scholarship, one of seventeen awarded nationally. I also spent time helping my fellow students with school work, projects, and test prep.</p>
